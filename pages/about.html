            <h2>About Chef Jylix</h2>
            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    Chef Jylix is a website dedicated to making simple recipes readily accessible to everyone.
                    We specialize in low-cost, easy-to-make dishes that will make eating well come naturally.
                </p>
                <h3>Meet the Author</h3>
                <p>
                    Ben Carlson is the author of Chef Jylix. When he was a young boy, his mother was very frugal,
                    always using cheap ingredients to make healthy, delicious dishes. Ben learned cooking skills
                    from his mother, and when he moved out, he kept cooking for himself. Roommates and friends
                    always commented on his cooking, noting how skilled he was. But Ben didn't think he was that
                    good. He just used simple recipes with simple ingredients. Then Ben had an epiphany. Maybe
                    that's all you needed in order to be a good cook: a good recipe and the right ingredients.
                    <br/><br/>
                    So Ben kept searching for more recipes he could make that would be low-cost and simple.
                    He spent a lot of time looking at online recipe pages, comparing different ways to make 
                    the same dish, until he came up with a simpler, easier way to make it. He experimented with
                    different strategies until he found one that he liked.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In going about his learning of new recipes, Ben noticed that most of the recipe websites he
                    visited were very difficult to navigate. Many of them had long, annoying stories before the 
                    recipe, and he had to scroll a long way down before he could find anything about how to make 
                    the food! A lot of recipes had ingredients listed that he had never heard of, or that he knew
                    were too expensive for his budget (being a college student at the time). Then Ben had an idea.
                </p>
                <h3>How Chef Jylix Got Started</h3>
                <p>
                    The author, Ben Carlson, needed to do a creativeproject for his Web Design class. Since he 
                    had used quite a few recipe websites that were just terrible, he thought he might make his
                    own recipe website. It could be the recipe website he always wished he could have found.
                    A website with simple recipes that used low-cost ingredients. Something that college students
                    could use to get a break from the PB&J or spending countless dollars at food-courts. And so 
                    Chef Jylix began as a school project.
                </p>
                <h3>Improvement Over The Years</h3>
                <p>
                    Chef Jylix has existed for only a few days. It hasn't had much time to improve. But don't worry!
                    The author, Ben Carlson, is hard at work making it his dream recipe website! Give it a while
                    and it will be the best one out there!
                </p>
