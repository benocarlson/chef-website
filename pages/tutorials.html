            <h2>Basic Cooking Skills</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    In order to cook, you're gonna need to know a few basic kitchen skills, like using
                    a knife, thawing and handling meat, and sauteeing. This page will explain how these
                    simple tasks are done.
                </p>
                <h3>Handling a Knife</h3>
                <p>
                    When holding a knife, pinch with the thumb and fore-finger at the base of the blade.
                    Curl the fore-finger away from the knife-edge, and wrap the rest of the fingers
                    around the handle. This gives you the most control over the blade. In this position
                    you can apply more pressure because your hand is right above the knife as you cut.
                    Be sure to keep your knives sharp, or you still might slip and cut yourself!
                </p>
                <h3>Chopping an Onion</h3>
                <p>
                    For most things, chopping and dicing are pretty straightforward. Cut into slices,
                    Then cut the slices into sticks, then cut the sticks into cubes. But onions are
                    more difficult because of their layers.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Start by cutting the onion in half, through the root, along the core, as shown. 
                    Then cut the stem end off. Now the peel will come off easily. The reason we cut the
                    onion along the core like this is because the root will hold all of the layers together
                    as we dice. Now, if you want to make "julienne" strips of onion, slice perpendicular to 
                    the core starting at the stem end, and break up the layers. Or, if dicing, first make cuts 
                    running from the stem end to about a centimeter off of the root. Don't cut all the way or 
                    the root won't hold the layers together. Then slice perpendicular to the core and break up 
                    the layers.
                </p>
                <h3>Sauteeing</h3>
                <p>
                    Sauteeing means cooking small pieces of things in just a little bit of oil. 
                    It's a great way to prepare meat and vegetables before using them in a larger dish.
                </p>
                <h4>Meat</h4>
                <p>
                    When you sautee red meat, like beef or pork, there is usually enough fat in the meat
                    itself that you don't have to add any oil. When you sautee poultry, like chicken, you will
                    want to add about a tablespoon of cooking oil for every half-pound of meat.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Cook the meat over a medium heat, stirring and turning the meat with a spoon or spatula
                    every minute or so until the meat is thoroughly cooked. You can break up larger 
                    pieces of meat to see if the inside is cooked all the way. When the meat has changed color
                    all the way through, it's done!
                </p>
                <h4>Vegetables</h4>
                <p>
                    Sauteeing vegetables is much simpler. Add about a tablespoon of cooking oil for every half-pound 
                    of vetetables. Cook over a medium heat and turn and stir every minute or so until the 
                    edges of the pieces of vegetable start to get browned, or until the vegetables are soft
                    and break easily.
